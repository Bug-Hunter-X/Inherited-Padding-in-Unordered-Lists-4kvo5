This repository demonstrates a common CSS issue: inherited padding in unordered lists. The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version. The problem arises from the padding applied to the `<ul>` element inadvertently affecting the `<li>` elements, causing unexpected spacing. The solution resets the padding on the list items, ensuring correct spacing.
